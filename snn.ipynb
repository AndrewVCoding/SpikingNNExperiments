    "In a real neuron, various different ions within the cell determine its membrane potential, most notable Sodium and Potasium. Sodium provides a negative charge and Potassium provides a positive charge. Across the membrane of the neuron are different channels that allow the passage of ions into and out of the cell, either passively or actively, such as the Sodium/Pottasium pump, which pumps out two Pottasium ions and brings in one Sodium ion. There are many more ions involved, but this simple model will only utilize generic positive and negative ions which I'll refer to as Sodium and Pottasium respectively so that future projects may more easily build off of this one by adding more ion types."
